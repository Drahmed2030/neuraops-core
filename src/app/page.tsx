You had some nausea for the first two weeks on the medication but that has gone away now. You work as a graphic designer with a demanding job.

    options:["Administer thrombolytics immediately","Activate cath lab — primary PCI is gold standard","Give IV morphine and observe","Start heparin infusion and repeat ECG in 30 minutes"],
    correct:1,
    explanation:"Primary PCI is the gold standard for STEMI if available within 120 minutes. Door-to-balloon time <90 minutes is the target. Thrombolytics are only used when PCI is not available within 120 minutes."

    correct:1,
    explanation:"Massive PE with hemodynamic instability and RV strain is an indication for systemic thrombolysis when not contraindicated. Alteplase 100mg IV over 2 hours is standard. Surgical embolectomy is reserved for failed thrombolysis or contraindications."

    correct:1,
    explanation:"Right ventricular infarction (suggested by ST elevation in V4R with inferior STEMI) is an absolute contraindication to nitrates. The RV is preload-dependent — nitrates cause dangerous hypotension. Treatment is IV fluid boluses and maintaining RV preload."

    explanation:"PEA arrest requires aggressive search for reversible causes (4H's: Hypoxia, Hypovolemia, Hypothermia, Hypo/Hyperkalemia; 4T's: Tension PTX, Tamponade, Thrombosis, Toxins). Low ETCO₂ (<10) suggests poor perfusion. Hypothermia and exertion collapse suggest hypovolemia or electrolyte abnormality."

    explanation:"Acute Pulmonary Edema management: Position upright (reduces preload), IV furosemide (diuresis + venodilation), GTN (preload/afterload reduction — safe as BP is high), BiPAP (reduces work of breathing, recruits alveoli). Avoid fluids — the problem is fluid overload."

    options:["Start insulin infusion immediately","IV fluids (normal saline) first, then replace potassium before starting insulin","Give sodium bicarbonate for acidosis","Start subcutaneous insulin"],
    correct:1,
    explanation:"DKA management priority: (1) IV fluids first — 1L NS in 1st hour. (2) Replace potassium BEFORE starting insulin — insulin drives K+ into cells and will worsen hypokalemia causing fatal arrhythmias. (3) Only then start insulin infusion. Bicarbonate is rarely needed and can worsen cerebral edema."

    correct:1,
    explanation:"Hypertensive emergency with end-organ damage requires controlled BP reduction. TARGET: reduce MAP by no more than 25% in the first hour to avoid cerebral and coronary hypoperfusion. IV labetalol or nicardipine are preferred agents. Overly rapid correction can cause watershed infarcts."
